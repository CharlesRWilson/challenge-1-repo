# Code Refactor Starter Code

## This is the refactored starter code for Challenge 1.

### By Charles Wilson

#### HTML
* I consolidated the text in each section to make it easier to read in vs code.
* I changed "div" to "section" for the topic section and "aside" for the aside section.
* Fixed the search engine optimization link
#### CSS
* I made all of the boxes the same color
* I added a background color
* I consolidated the CSS selector sections to make them more readable.
